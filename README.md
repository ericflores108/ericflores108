In February 2019, I graduated from Fordham University with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Economics. I am interested in programming, data science, probability and statistics.

In my free time, I enjoy film photography, music, swimming, biking, and running (marathon / long-distance runner). I also love to read! Some of my favorite books include Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela, Half of a Yellow Sun, and To Kill a Mockingbird.

I look forward to connecting with you about similar interests or industry related topics.
