In February 2019, I graduated from Fordham University with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Economics. I am interested in programming, data science, probability and statistics. My favorite programming languages are TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python. 

In my free time, I enjoy film photography, music, swimming, biking, and running (marathon / long-distance runner). I also love to read! Some of my favorite books include [Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B0015T6G2G&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_390VXVDSADEA20PAS65Q), [Half of a Yellow Sun](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B001L83PLQ&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_T4DHZ6AAY415RK1NQFJF), and [To Kill a Mockingbird](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00K0OI42W&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_75AQAK5ZJYZ1NR5B74VN).
